ediff replacement - stock can't quit properly - infinite macro loop when trying to restore windows?

is chord mode messing with my timing? i release control, then press backspace ... disabled for now. maybe it was key/backspace replaces region. i should probably disable that too.

i like isearch setting region, but when i do any movement or C-g out of search, it should restore old mark (or lack of one). i only have it set region so i can yank or mark-multiple
