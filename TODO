greedy-whitespace munching fwd/back delete - leave one space if there was more than 1. also cross line boundaries. check existing dwim el first? - http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/motion-and-kill-dwim.el

eval shell advice from http://snarfed.org/why_i_run_shells_inside_emacs

move char (from wrap-region {} closing) up/down line as well as left/right. keybind all 4.

autopair annoys me. disable entirely? or enable only when at end of line, or cursor not already on a char? fns to wrap the autopair binds or advice. or if char already on something, put matching } at eol (decided to quote something). or at least allow type-over (match already inserted char to exit, e.g. "a" - can either right-arrow or " to advance)
